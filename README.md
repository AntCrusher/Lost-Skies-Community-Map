# Found Skies

The Lost Skies community did an incredible job mapping out the world.

This is just a simple Nuxt application based on https://fancyapps.com/panzoom/ to have an easy way to pan and zoom the map

Thank you to NoxX, Cailco and the community for providing the map itself.

The interactive map can be found here: https://antcrusher.github.io/Lost-Skies-Community-Map/

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AntCrusher/Lost-Skies-Community-Map.git
